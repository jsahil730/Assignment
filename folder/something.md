# Great going

You've done a great job reaching here! The next thing to learn are commits. Commits are snapshots of the repository at different points
in time and allow you to make some related changes together, that is, you can add a feature by say modifying tens of files; and all
those changes can be made a part of the same commit. With commits, you can go back (and forth?)in time and thus you can revert that
feature if it broke something down. Commits can also have messages associated with them, depicting the changes made; and are
uniquely identified by hashes. The first part of the flag is the type of hash used by git as default, can you find it!

Moreover, can you find something interesting in the commits in this repository?
