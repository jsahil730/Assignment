Thanks for visiting here!

Since this task involves a bit of learning about Git & Github; there'll be some text which you'll have to read
and then you may need to search around to find the flag, or some words of it!

As a starting point, **branches** are really useful when several people are working on some project(in git terms, we may call it a repository)
Branches allow developers to develop their product as a different copy, where they could add features, test them and much more;
and when required, these branches can be merged with each other so that the original product also contains those features.  

Moreover, developers can work on their branch(es) independent of other developers on same or different branch(es).
Therefore, the usual use of branches is to have each feature in it's own branch \& one of the branches, usually master/main, corresponds to
the current working version of the product and the deployment may also be done from such a branch.

For the first part of the flag, try to find all the branches in this repository and see if you can observe a flag or it's mention somewhere.
