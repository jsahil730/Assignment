I have been giving CTFs for the past few months quite regularly, and my cybersec journey began with the picoCTF which I gave with my friends last year. Since then, I have learnt a lot in cryptography, reversing and pwning, have tried reading the Web Application Hacker's Handbook and what not! Having done that, I seek to keep learning and get our team to perform really well in the global CTFs :) Oh yes, we also need more team members :P
Well I do feel like our institute does lack in cybersec a lot(especially academically), and something should be done about the same. 

Nevermind, let's get started with the writeups!
