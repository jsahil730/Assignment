Awesome! You've discovered so much so far! The second part of the flag is the default branch name used by Github for a new repository.
To find the rest of the flag, you'll have to be acquainted with forks.

Forks are essentially copies of the old repository which can have their own branches and the development here
progresses independent of the development of the main repository. Forks are usually used when either the main repository
has been abandoned or the patch(es) to certain dependencies are essential(when it is impossible to wait for
the merge of the patches) or when you don't have write access to the main repository but still want to contribute!

Can you find the forks of this repository and therefore the rest of the flag?
